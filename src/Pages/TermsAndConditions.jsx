          Customers using foreign and international cards should note that this online payment gateway accepts payments only in Indian Rupees. Therefore, the amount charged is the Indian Rupee value of the product displayed on the site which is converted into US Dollars or any other foreign currency at the actual prevailing conversion rate while passing on the order to the payment gateway. Similarly for any applicable refunds the full Indian Rupee amount, which has been charged, is refunded which is converted into US Dollars or any other foreign currency at the actual prevailing conversion rate. The difference, if any, in the refund and amount charged is due to the fluctuation of the conversion rate. In some cases where an international credit card has been used, the Credit Card Issuing Company levies a transaction charge for any charge / refund issued. The applicable charge is decided by the issuing bank. The Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation Ltd. is not responsible for any charge levied by the credit card issuing bank for the foreign transaction or charge or tax levied by the credit card Issuing Bank or Gateway provider Slot Online.
